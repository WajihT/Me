              Hey! I'm a Computer Science student and cybersecurity enthusiast, currently studying at the University of Augsburg. I previously studied at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) and now work as a Working Student at Brainlab.
              I'm passionate about building products that make a difference, whether by improving someoneâ€™s daily life or simply letting me have fun while exploring new technologies. <br/>
              I'm also building my own home lab, where I host and experiment with self-deployed services to deepen my hands-on experience. <br/>
              Outside of work and study, I'm a big fan of Goldfinches and Canaries. I'm currently on my journey toward earning the CPTS (Certified Penetration Testing Specialist) certification and continuously learning more about ethical hacking and network security.
